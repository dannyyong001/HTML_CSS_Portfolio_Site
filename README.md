Responsive personal portfolio website, made solely of HTML and CSS.

Responsive Personal Portfolio Website (HTML & CSS)
Welcome to the repository for my responsive personal portfolio website! This project is a testament to the power and flexibility of pure HTML and CSS in crafting elegant, engaging, and highly adaptable web experiences. Designed from the ground up with a mobile-first approach, this portfolio ensures a seamless and visually appealing presentation of my work, skills, and professional journey across a myriad of devices and screen sizes.

Project Overview
This personal portfolio website serves as a digital showcase for my skills and projects as a developer. It's built entirely with foundational web technologies: HTML for structure and content, and CSS for styling and responsiveness. The absence of JavaScript libraries or frameworks underscores a deep understanding of core web development principles and a commitment to optimized performance and accessibility.

Key Features
Pure HTML & CSS Implementation: No external JavaScript frameworks or libraries are used, demonstrating proficiency in fundamental web technologies and ensuring lightweight, fast-loading pages.
Fully Responsive Design: The layout fluidly adapts to various screen sizes, from mobile phones and tablets to desktops and large monitors. This is achieved through:
Flexible Box Layout (Flexbox): Utilized for efficient, one-dimensional layout control, ensuring elements arrange themselves gracefully.
Media Queries: Custom breakpoints are carefully defined to apply specific styles and optimize the user experience at different viewport widths.
Relative Units: Extensive use of em, rem, vw, vh, and percentages ensures elements scale proportionally with the viewport, maintaining design integrity across devices.
Clean and Semantic HTML5 Structure: The codebase adheres to modern HTML5 best practices, using semantic tags (<header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>, <footer>, etc.) to enhance readability, maintainability, and accessibility.
Modern CSS3 Styling: Leverages advanced CSS3 features for visual appeal, including:
Custom Properties (CSS Variables): For efficient theme management and consistent styling across the site.
Transitions & Transforms: Smooth animations and interactive elements enhance user engagement without relying on JavaScript.
rgba() and rgb() Colors: Used for creating semi-transparent backgrounds and modern color schemes that integrate seamlessly with various sections.
Custom Fonts & Typography: Thoughtful font selection and typographic hierarchy improve readability and visual aesthetics.
Intuitive User Interface (UI): Designed with user experience in mind, featuring clear navigation, readable content, and a logical flow of information.
Accessibility (A11y) Conscious: Efforts have been made to ensure the website is usable by as many people as possible, including those with disabilities, by focusing on:
Semantic HTML.
Meaningful alt text for images.
Proper use of form elements.
Clear focus states for interactive elements.
Consideration for keyboard navigation.

Optimized Performance:
Minimal file sizes due to no external libraries.
Efficient CSS selector usage.
Optimized image delivery (though not explicitly demonstrated in this codebase, good practice assumed).
Interactive Elements with Pure CSS: Showcase interactive components (like navigation menus or hover effects) achieved solely through CSS, demonstrating creative problem-solving without JavaScript dependency.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For structuring the content.
CSS3: For all styling, layout, and responsiveness.
